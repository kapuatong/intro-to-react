1. In your own words, explain React's Virtual DOM. What gives React its fast performance?

The `render` method generates a representation of an element. When there is a change, 
the UI is re-rendered in the virtual DOM representation. The difference between the old 
and new representation is calculated. And changes are made to the actual DOM. 
Being able to calculate the difference, allows for there to be minimal changes to the DOM. 
Essentially the virtual DOM makes it so that only what needs to be changed gets changed. 

2. In your own words, describe React's core concept of uni-directional data flow. Draw diagrams to illustrate. 
Discuss the answer with your mentor in your next session.

React’s one way data flow makes it deterministic, making it a simpler logic to follow in developing. 
Instead of everything being connected in a 2-way binding like a spider web, this uni-directional 
flow allows for things to be cleaner. There’s no back and forth between components. It goes 
from `UI` ==> `EVENT` ==> `COMPONENT` ==> `WATCHER` and right back to `UI`. Makes it a nice cycle.
