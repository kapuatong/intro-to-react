WHY REACT?

1. In your own words, explain single-page applications and progressive web apps.

SPA’s are one page of HTML loades that updates through AJAX calls, that return data, not markup. 
Traditional pages reloads the page for every interaction. PWA’s are websites that look and feel like an app, 
but without downloading a mobile app.

2. Either from your research or by inspecting popular sites you frequent (using the Chrome DevTools), 
give some real-world examples of applications built with React and Angular.

Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, WhatsApp.

3. Write a summary of the benefits of React vs. Angular. Then ask your mentor about the current state of web development, 
and ask questions about how they use these two popular technologies in their work.

React is a library while Angular is a whole framework. Making Angular huge compared to React. 
Angular has a lot of out of the box features while React is minimalistic. With React being smaller it could 
be easier to learn. Both are used in the job field now, React is also getting more popular in the industry. 
Talking with my mentor Kevin, it all just come down to what the job is. Depending where I will be working in the future, 
different things could be necessary or useful for the project.
